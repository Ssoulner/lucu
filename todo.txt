typechecking todo:
- fail type in handlers
- fail type of implicit handlers/naked handler calls
- handler function must match signature
- functions that return handlers must not be (mutually) recursive
- functions must not be (mutually) recursive through try blocks

parser todo:
- operator precedence

todo:
- packages
- prelude
- separate generation code from data types

would be nice:
- tokenizer matches brackets
- seperate token from data
- custom anchor tokens per Parse instance
- analyzer gives semantic IR
- try blocks no longer their own function
